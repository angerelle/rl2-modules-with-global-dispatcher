rl2-modules-with-global-dispatcher
==================================

An example of communication between module and shell using Robotlegs 2&#39;s  ScopedEventDispatcherExtension

The app just consists of a shell containing a ColorPicker and a module containing a filled rectangle.  When the module is loaded, choosing a colour in the ColorPicker should change the fill colour of the rectangle.
